# backend-project-docker

💫A dockerized full stack todo application that uses a NodeJS backend, a PostgreSQL database and JWT Authentification.

This todo backend application consists of three sub-projects.

👋In the first project, I build a basic server application and render the client data from the server side. Also, used REST Client for Client Emulation.

🙌In the second todo application, where I tried to do a sign-up and login application with modern backend technoligies, such as bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken and express.js to authentificate users for signup and allowing them to login. Also, by using jsonwebtoken, saved the token to localStorage to persist customer's login and todo information. By using bcryptjs, I refreshened my skills to encrypt users' passwords. Also, for DB, I used SQLite of Node.js, a fast lightweight DB for quick database queries.

🏆In the third and last project, I am learning how to use Prisma ORM for PostgreSQL queries and finally try to dockerize the project successfully to Docker.
